🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Welcome to the NLP repository! This space is dedicated to exploring various concepts, projects, and practical applications in Natural Language Processing using Python, machine learning, and deep learning frameworks.

🚀 Topics Covered / Planned
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, etc.)

Sentiment Analysis

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Part-of-Speech Tagging

Text Classification

Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)

Transformer models (BERT, GPT, etc.)

Chatbots

Language modeling

Topic Modeling (LDA)

Sequence-to-Sequence models

NLP for Indian Languages (if applicable)

🛠️ Technologies Used:-
Python

NLTK, spaCy, Gensim

scikit-learn

TensorFlow / PyTorch

Hugging Face Transformers

Jupyter Notebooks / Streamlit (for visualization and deployment)
